# Challenges Faced
Referencing spreadsheet into our python code to make the data accessible.
API linking and google permissions & authentication.
Datatype conversion in few columns.
Visualising data using matplotlib.

# Conclusions

Analyzed the data of BSE stock and plotted different graphs which shows various insights about the data and it would be very helpfull for a person who invest into those comapnies which gives maximum return.

Observed  Price to Earning as the Key Performance Indicator and concluded that Adani group  are leading in the market and if invested in those companies the client would most probably get high returns.

In ideal condition the income should be more then the expence as that allows the client to invest his money and get better returns.
